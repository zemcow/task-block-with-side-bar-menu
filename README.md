# task-block-with-side-bar-menu
that is simple task bar with side bar menu


And it looks like this
![Prewiew](https://github.com/zemcow/task-block-with-side-bar-menu/blob/main/img/prewiew.png?raw=true)

If you want to change something in the project, I advise you to change them in the style.scss file, since the variables that contain the color properties are detailed there.
The extension and so on will already have to be changed manually ...

Also, this block is fully adapted to any type of device.
